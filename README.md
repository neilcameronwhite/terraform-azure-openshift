Bootstraping
------------
### Setup
Make sure you have Terraform in your PATH.

Log in into Azure using [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest):

```
az login
```

Modify the variables in ```bootstrap.tfvars``` to change the name of the resource group, number of nodes, size and OS of the VMs and the domains or subdomains that will be associated with OpenShift:

```
azure_location = "East US"
azure_resource_group_name = "openshift"
openshift_node_count = "2"
openshift_master_count = "3"
openshift_infra_count = "2"
openshift_node_vm_size = "Standard_B2s"
openshift_master_vm_size = "Standard_B2s"
openshift_infra_vm_size = "Standard_B2ms"
openshift_bastion_vm_size = "Standard_B2ms"
openshift_master_domain = "openshift.mydomain.com"
openshift_router_domain = "mydomain.com"
openshift_os_image_publisher = "OpenLogic"
openshift_os_image_offer = "CentOS"
openshift_os_image_sku = "7.5"
openshift_os_image_version = "latest"
openshift_vm_admin_user = "cloud-user"
```

You can tweak the OpenShift inventory file, it's [here](templates/openshift-inventory).

### Bootstrap

Simply run:
```
./bootstrap.sh
```

When finished, you will get the public IPs for the Bastion host and for both the External Load Balancer and the Router Load Balancer.

In order to SSH into the Bastion host use the key in the ```certs``` folder:
```
ssh -i certs/bastion.key cloud-user@BASTION_IP
```

The ```oc``` command is configured to be used in the Bastion host.

If something failed during the installation you can run ```bootstrap.sh``` again.

### Notes

Terraform verions used for this plan
```
Terraform v0.12.13
+ provider.azurerm v1.36.1
```
